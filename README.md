# SPACE DEMO

[!["Buy Me A Coffee"](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/victwise)

I made this demo in Flutter inspired by a project in [behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/68621221/Projects-Review-2017-18/modules/400959917).

# DETAILS

Here I detail in the following general way the development process: I have slowly enlarged the stars, to give it intention that they shine, so I also created a CustomPainter for the semicircle, where the selected planets would be shown, directed by two buttons, these buttons, also direct the representation of the planet for which the astronaut sees, also the giant text, I am using AnimatedSwitcher so that it has a better transition between titles, when you click on the name of the planet it goes to another screen, showing the planet rotating in X, this is thanks to the package 'flutter_cube', that allows me to give this rotation.

If you like the animation let me know, feedback is appreciated.
